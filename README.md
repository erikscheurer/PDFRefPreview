The script works by following internal links to the target page and location, and render the view in a separate canvas. Some PDFs may not work because the internal links are broken.

This script only works if the viewer is [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/).

## Firefox

PDF.js is the default viewer in Firefox. To install the script, create a bookmark and add the code below to the `URL` field. Use the bookmark to toggle enable/disable preview after a PDF has been loaded.

```js:src/bookmark.js
```
